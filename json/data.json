The team analyzed the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality emissions inventory dataset from 1991 to 2022 using RStudio for data wrangling. The dataset included information about the amount and type of pollutants released by industrial facilities in Louisiana. The project identified the limitations of the dataset, which can impact the accuracy of measuring pollution from companies. The team also identified the top 15 cancer-causing chemicals and their sources, as recognized by the National Institutes of Health and the National Toxicology Program. This project used RStudio and data wrangling techniques to conduct an analysis of industrial emissions in Louisiana and their potential impact on public health.",

To enhance the game's playability, an AI agent has been implemented using Genetic Algorithms, which are rooted in natural selection and genetics. The project's objective is to train an agent using N number of generations, with the aim of enabling it to complete at least the first level of World 1 by the N+1 generation. To accomplish this, the project requires the use of PyBoy, a GameBoy emulator built in Python, and Python itself.",
