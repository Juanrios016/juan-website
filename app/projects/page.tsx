                                    Super Mario World is a platform game that consist mainly on getting from point A to point B. The implementation of an AI agent to learn how to play this game incorporates Genetic Algorithms which are based on the ideas of natural selection and genetics. The goal of this project is that after N generations of size M, in generation N+1 and agent will be able to complete at least the first level of world 1. The tools needed are PyBoy, which is a GamBoy emulator developed in Python, and Python.

                                    The aim of this group project is to help Macalester College students find their corresponding classrooms for their different courses. The idea started with personal experiences in how much time we spent on finding a classroom every semester, specially if we have never taken a class at a building. This version is built mainly using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
